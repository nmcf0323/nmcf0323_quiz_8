# Week 8 Quiz
## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
My chosen source of inspiration is the works of Japanese contemporary artist **Yayoi Kusama**. Polka dots are the trademark motif of her work, inspired by the visual hallucinations that she experiences;
> "Earth, moon, sun and human beings all represent dotes; a single particle among billions."
- *Yayoi Kusama*

 These polka dots can vary in size and placement to create abstraction or an image. I would like to explore this technique to recreate one of the chosen artworks in the style of Kusama. The degree of abstraction can be varied through the size and arrangement of the polka dots. These variables also create potential for animation through audio, timer events, noise or user input.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
**Pointillism** could be used to implement Kusama’s polka dot technique in p5.js code. This coding technique links the pixels of an image to the drawing of coloured ellipses. Animation and interactivity can be introduced to draw various ellipses sizes to slowly build up an image, much like the work of Kusama. However, in order to accurately replicate Kusama’s style, the coding technique would need to be modified so that the drawn ellipses do not overlap.
